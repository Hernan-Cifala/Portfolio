          <h3>Professional Development</h3>
        
            <p>I am an analytical thinker with a strong technical background and a passion for development. My focus is on creating solutions for small and medium-sized businesses using low-code platforms and prompt engineering, driving growth and efficiency through digital projects.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about technology, that set of tools that enables the fusion of creative thinking and technical approach, allowing us to create, share, and connect innovative ideas.</p>

            <p>Throughout my learning journey, I have completed a series of online courses and acquired knowledge in various technologies. Even in my current job, I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to continue learning and growing professionally.</p>
